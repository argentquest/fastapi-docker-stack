Test 06: End-to-End Integration Test

This script performs a comprehensive end-to-end test that validates the entire
application stack by simulating a complete user workflow.

It verifies that all services work together correctly:
- The FastAPI app orchestrates the workflow.
- OpenRouter generates a response.
- The Embedding service creates a vector.
- MinIO stores the resulting file.
- PostgreSQL logs the transaction.
- Redis caches the result.

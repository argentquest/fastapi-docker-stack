}
```

**Issue Analysis:**
- API key format appears correct (sk-or-v1-...)
- Environment variable properly set in .env
- Container receiving wrong cached API key
- Requires API key validation/rotation

| pgAdmin | http://localhost:5050/ | ✅ | 302 Redirect (normal) |

### 7. Inter-Service Communication ✅

**Network Connectivity Test:** PASSED
```
App -> postgres:5432 - Connected
App -> redis:6379 - Connected  
App -> minio:9000 - Connected
```

**Service Dependencies:**
- ✅ App waits for healthy dependencies before starting
- ✅ Health checks preventing premature startup
- ✅ Network isolation working correctly
- ✅ Internal DNS resolution functional

### 8. Logging & Monitoring ✅

**Comprehensive Logging Implemented:**
- ✅ Application startup/shutdown events logged
- ✅ Service initialization steps documented
- ✅ Health check results logged with details
- ✅ Error conditions properly logged with stack traces
- ✅ Performance metrics captured (embedding generation timing)

**Recent Log Sample:**
```
